  <!-- OVERVIEW -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      During the pandemic, life became fragmented and emotionally challenging for many.
      Individuals were juggling multiple tools to track mental health, journal daily
      experiences, and stay connected with loved ones — all at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gap inspired <strong>Alienpooh</strong>: a unified digital platform designed
      to support emotional well-being, simplify life organization, and foster meaningful
      connections in a world where physical proximity was not always possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Product Designer, I led the UX process end-to-end — from research and ideation
      to high-fidelity design and system definition — shaping a holistic experience rooted
      in empathy and emotional resonance.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CHALLENGE -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      In a landscape of isolated tools, users were overwhelmed because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Life-management tools were fragmented across different apps</li>
      <li>No single space combined emotional tracking, journaling, and social connection</li>
      <li>Users felt disconnected and unsupported during periods of isolation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The core challenge became:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        How do we design a unified platform that is intuitive, comprehensive,
        emotionally supportive, and delightful to use?
      </strong>
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- USERS -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Understanding the Users</h2>
    <p>
      To ground the product in real needs, I conducted analysis and empathy mapping to
      uncover deeper insights about users.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Users felt overwhelmed managing multiple disconnected tools</li>
      <li>Many craved emotional closeness with loved ones, even virtually</li>
      <li>Emotional design was often overlooked in existing solutions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These insights became the foundation of Alienpooh’s experience, guiding both
      structural decisions and interaction priorities.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- VISION -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Vision & Ideation</h2>
    <p>
      With a grounded understanding of user needs, I defined a clear vision for Alienpooh.
    </p>

    <h4>Big Idea</h4>
    <p>Create a personal digital space where users can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Track mental wellness</li>
      <li>Maintain meaningful journals</li>
      <li>Connect emotionally with others</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Design Principles</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> — reduce cognitive load through intuitive workflows</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional design</strong> — evoke calm and connection through visuals</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> — support diverse emotional states and journeys</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- UX APPROACH -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>UX Approach</h2>

    <h4>Market Research & Audit</h4>
    <p>
      I analyzed competing platforms to understand how existing solutions addressed
      life management. The research revealed a clear gap: no product offered an integrated,
      emotionally supportive environment combining mental well-being, journaling,
      and social connection.
    </p>

    <h4>Wireframes & Prototyping</h4>
    <p>
      I translated early concepts into wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes to visualize
      user flows and validate assumptions. These iterations helped identify friction points
      early and ensured alignment with user expectations.
    </p>

    <h4>Design Execution</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>High-fidelity designs balancing functionality with emotional warmth</li>
      <li>A reusable design system (typography, color, interactions)</li>
      <li>Continuous feedback loops with users, stakeholders, and developers</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- OUTCOME -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Emotional support and social connection in a single platform</li>
      <li>Reduced mental effort by consolidating multiple tools</li>
      <li>Serene, intuitive, and engaging user experience</li>
      <li>Scalable system ready for future growth</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

</main>

<!-- REFLECTION -->
<section class="project-reflection">
  <p>
    This project taught me that designing beyond functionality is essential.
  </p>
  <p>
    Emotional design matters — users don’t just interact with products, they feel them.
    Rapid iteration and adaptability enabled Alienpooh to evolve into a resilient,
    human-centered platform prepared for long-term growth.
