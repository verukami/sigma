  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <section class="case-section reveal">
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      During my time at Globant, I worked on CitiBanamex’s digital banking platform at a moment of transformation.
      The work spanned three parallel initiatives critical to the product’s evolution:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The redesign of BancaNet, CitiBanamex’s core digital banking platform</li>
      <li>The definition and delivery of a shared design system across teams</li>
      <li>The ideation of personalized product discovery components</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Each initiative addressed different layers of the product while sharing the same goal:
      improving clarity, trust, scalability, and user engagement in a regulated financial environment.
    </p>

  <!-- ROLE -->
  <section class="case-section reveal">
    <h2>Role</h2>
    <p class="meta">
      Product Designer (UX Strategy, Interaction Design, Design Systems)<br />
      Globant — 2020
    </p>

    <p>
      I was responsible for defining UX strategy and interaction patterns across these three streams,
      working independently while aligning with product, engineering, and other designers.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WORKSTREAM 1 -->
  <section class="case-section reveal">
    <h2>Workstream 1 — BancaNet Redesign</h2>

    <h3>Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      BancaNet’s core journeys had grown fragmented over time, increasing cognitive load
      and reducing users’ ability to complete tasks efficiently.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Decisions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Restructured the information architecture to simplify navigation</li>
      <li>Redesigned core flows to reduce friction and errors</li>
      <li>Prioritized clarity and accessibility to reinforce trust</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved usability across core banking tasks</li>
      <li>Reduced friction in high-frequency flows</li>
      <li>Stronger foundations for future feature growth</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- WORKSTREAM 2 -->
  <section class="case-section reveal">
    <h2>Workstream 2 — Design System Delivery (BlueBox)</h2>

    <h3>Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Multiple teams were designing in parallel without shared standards,
      resulting in inconsistencies and duplicated effort.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Decisions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Defined reusable components and interaction patterns</li>
      <li>Ensured scalability across products and regulatory contexts</li>
      <li>Aligned design decisions with development workflows</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Increased consistency across digital products</li>
      <li>Faster design and development cycles</li>
      <li>Stronger alignment between design and engineering</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- WORKSTREAM 3 -->
  <section class="case-section reveal">
    <h2>Workstream 3 — Personalized Product Discovery</h2>

    <h3>Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Users were unaware of the breadth of CitiBanamex’s product offering,
      and existing cross-sell mechanisms were generic and poorly timed.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Decisions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed personalized discovery modules embedded in key journeys</li>
      <li>Prioritized contextual relevance over static promotion</li>
      <li>Built modular, reusable components</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Increased engagement with product discovery features</li>
      <li>Better visibility of CitiBanamex’s ecosystem</li>
      <li>Scalable patterns for future growth</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- OUTCOME -->
  <section class="case-section reveal">
    <h2>Outcome & Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved engagement and clarity across core journeys</li>
      <li>Reusable system components adopted by multiple teams</li>
      <li>Stronger user trust through accessible design</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- REFLECTION -->
  <section class="case-section reveal">
    <h2>Closing Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Designing simultaneously at the experience, system, and growth layers reinforced the importance
      of holistic product thinking. This project demonstrates how product design can drive usability,
      scalability, and business impact when decisions are made beyond individual features.
